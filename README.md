# Tetris in C++ using SFML

## Project Description
This project is an implementation of the classic Tetris game in C++ using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). The game allows the player to stack blocks to form complete lines and earn points. The project's goal is not only to create a functional game but also to learn object-oriented programming and integration with a graphics library.

## Requirements
1. C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
2. SFML library - [SFML Installation Instructions](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php)

## Running the Game
1. In order to run game without compiling it again, download the project folder from github
2. Run the .exe file.
